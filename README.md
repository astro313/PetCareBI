# Motivation
68% of US household owns a pet and the annual cash flow of the pet service industry is >$10B, which is projected to continue growing in 2020 despite COVID-19.  To help busniess owners in this lucrative industry to stand out from their competitors and promote customer retention, PetCare BI is here to help you increase your customer satistfaction score and lower the number of poor reviews. 
We understand that reviews are often overwhelming in length with information buried in unstructued text, written in different styles, and cover a few different aspects in a single review. PetCare BI is a business intelligence webapp with dashboard showing the key topics discussed in Yelp reviews, topic trends over the years, and for each review rating group. It also uses AI to provide executive summary to help you quickly gauge consumersâ€™ feedback on the services. With PetCare BI, time spent on reading and understanding reviews are reduced by >50%! 

Based on these insights, business owners can 
    1. determine which aspects of the business is having bigger issues with customers. 
    2. identify your USP (Unique selling proposition) to promo a brand that stands out from your competitors and enhance customer retention.
    3. improve service based on customer reviews and incentivize "turned away" customers --> updated review to attract more customers.
    4. strategize their marketing effort or business model based on latest trends (e.g., providing updates on pets in day care/boarding service).

# Technical aspects
PetCare BI is based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and SOTA T5 transformer model. 


# To Launch on EC2 using saved LDAmodel and dataset
1. `git clone git@github.com:astro313/MyPetCare.git`
2. `cd MyPetCare`
3. unzip LDAmodel.tgz and data.tgz
4. `docker image build -t streamlit:app .`
5. `docker container run -p 8501:8501 --name petcareBI -it -d streamlit:app bash`
6. `tmux new -s StreamlitWebApp`
7. `docker exec -it petcareBI bash`
8. `streamlit run webapp/app.py`


# To run from scratch to LDA_momdel part:

if scrape data:
    1. save zipcodes into .txt files in data/
    2. scrape_biz_link_multipage.py
    3. scrape_reviews.py
    4. zipcode_based_drop_dupl_biz.py
if create single pd dataframeframe w/ all reviews for creating new model:

    3. df_new.to_csv('data_model/cleaned_tokenized_df-2020-....csv', index=False)
if load cleaned dataframe only and use existing model:

    2. lda_model = streamlitapp.load_pretrain_ldamodel(fname=r'data_model/.....model')
